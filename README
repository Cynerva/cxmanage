To use this, you have to install it.

I recommend you use a virtualenv - it can be the same one you use for
hb_spif/socman/ipmitest etc.

To install, do something like "python setup.py develop" or "python setup.py
install".

After that, you should be able to use the 'cxmanage' utility from anywhere (as
long as you're in your virtualenv, if you're using one).
