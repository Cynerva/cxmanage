To use this, you have to install it.

The best way to do this is with virtualenv -- it can be the same one you use
for hb_spif/socman/ipmitest etc.



Setting up a virtualenv
-----------------------
If you don't have a virtualenv set up already, you can easily set up an
environment named "foo" with the following commands:

sudo apt-get install virtualenvwrapper
mkvirtualenv foo


Then any time you want to run cxmanage in the future, enter the environment
beforehand:

workon foo



Installing pyipmi
------------------------------
The cxmanage utility depends on ipmitool and pyipmi. You will need a recent
Calxeda version of ipmitool in your $PATH.


For now, you can pull pyipmi from git and install with these commands:

git clone ssh://git.calxeda.com/var/git/pyipmi.git
cd pyipmi
python setup.py develop


If you're not in a virtual environment, then you'll need sudo privileges for
the "python setup.py develop" command.



Installing cxmanage
-------------------
Finally, to install the cxmanage utility, run this from the cx_manage_util
folder:

python setup.py develop


This will install cxmanage, as well as the pexpect and tftpy python libraries
that it depends on.

Again, if you're not in a virtual environment, then you'll need sudo privileges
for the "python setup.py develop" command.

With ipmitool, pyipmi, and cxmanage installed, you should be good to go.
